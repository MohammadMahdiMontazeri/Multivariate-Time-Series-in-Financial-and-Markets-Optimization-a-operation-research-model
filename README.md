# Multivariate Time Series Analysis in Financial Markets

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of financial time series data from two major global corporations—Samsung and Apple—over the past decade. It includes exploratory analysis, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, and econometric time series modeling, emphasizing practical skills in financial data analytics.

### Project Overview:

### 1. Data Collection:
- **Data Sources**: Collected historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance for:
  - Samsung Electronics (`005930.KS`)
  - Apple Inc. (`AAPL`)
- **Time Period**: Data spans 10 years (June 30, 2013 - July 1, 2023).

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values and normalized data for accurate comparisons.
- Ensured data stationarity using econometric transformations for valid time series analysis.

### 3. Multivariate Time Series Analysis:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand price trends and volatility patterns.
- Utilized seasonal decomposition and stationarity transformations to identify underlying patterns and trends.

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction:
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality while preserving critical financial information.
- Analyzed resulting components to identify significant underlying factors influencing stock prices.

### 5. Econometric Modeling:
- Developed econometric models to predict future trends and evaluate the relationships between market variables.
- Applied statistical tests and model diagnostics to ensure robust results.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- Proficiency in collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing multivariate financial time series data.
- Understanding of PCA as a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction in financial analytics.
- Practical experience in econometric modeling and forecasting techniques for financial data.

### Libraries and Tools Used:
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas (data manipulation and numerical analysis)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)
- Statsmodels (time series decomposition and econometric modeling)
- Scikit-learn (data normalization, PCA)
- Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`) for financial data extraction

This project offers hands-on experience in advanced financial analytics techniques, making it suitable for practitioners, financial analysts, and data scientists.
